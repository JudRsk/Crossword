# Crossword
Crossword puzzle project for school

The abstract class AbstractSquare is a superclass for all other types of squares like BlueSquare, WhiteSquare, BlackSquare, GraySquare and CheckSquare. This means that the subclasses have access to the variables and methods of the superclass. The superclass also implements an interface Square so that all other subclasses also have the methods that are present in the interface. In this case only the method getColor() is present in the interface to get the color of the different types of squares. An AbstractSquare consists of an x-position and an y-position to determine the positions of the squares on the crossword puzzle. A BlackSquare is the only square-type that doesn’t have a character variable because it is not possible to add a character to a black square via the keyboard according to the rules. WhiteSquare, GraySquare, CheckSquare, BlueSquare all have a character variable because they should get a character input. They are initialized with an empty character ‘ ‘. The characters in these squares can be updated using the keyboard. The BlueSquare also has a blueValue variable. This character is determined by the input file and is one of the guaranteed options, along with 4 random characters, when a keyboard is made after a blue square is clicked. There are two types of gray squares. GraySquares are present in the crossword puzzle while CheckSquares are only present below the crossword puzzle. The CheckSquare class is used to check if the given input of the user is equal to the provided solution in the config.properites file. To do this, CheckSquare has a checkValue variable, this is the character given by the solution. In order to check if the input character is equal to the checkValue, there is a checkCharacters() method present. Both the checkValue and the character will be put in uppercase to make sure that even if the solution would be in lowercase and the input in uppercase, the answer can still be checked. Otherwise it would say that ‘SOUTHPARK’ is not equal to ‘southpark‘ while the answer is actually correct. 

The Puzzle class has height, width, an ArrayList of AbstractSquares and an ArrayList of Strings as variables. They are all determined by the input file. The height and width are the first two integers on the first line of the file. The following lines in the input file will determine the ArrayList of AbstractSquares. The next lines will form the text panel and these will be put into the ArrayList of Strings. When reading the file in the main method (in Crossword class) these variables will be set. The class also has two constructors with different amount of parameters. The constructor with no parameters is used to make the crosswordPuzzle (in Crossword class) because at first the width and height are not known yet. The constructor with the parameters width and height are used for the solPuzzle (in Crossword class) because these are known from the beginning. 

The SolutionPuzzle class is actually a type of Puzzle but it also has a CheckSquare ArrayList. So the SolutionPuzzle will be the gray squares under the crossword puzzle that will be used to check if the answer is equal to the solution. This will be checked with the checkSolution() method. This method will check if each CheckSquare has an input character equal to the checkValue that also uses the checkCharacter() method of CheckSquare. Every time a character is equal to a checkValue a counter (int h) will go up with 1. Only if the counter is equal to the size of the ArrayList will it mean that the answer is correct.

The CrosswordButton class is a class that extends JButton. That means that it will get all the properties from the JButton class. The CrosswordButton class also has AbstractSquare as a variable. That means that eventually the properties of both JButton and AbstractSquare are present in one class. This is used to give information, such as the input of the keyboard, not only to the buttons in the crossword, but also to the squares. In this way, the character variable of a square will be set to the chosen value.

The Keyboard class has frame (JFrame), keyPanel (JPanel), symbols (String[][]), crosswordButton, blueValue and listen (CustomButtonListener) as variables. The symbols variable contains all the letters of the keyboard. When a square (except black square) is clicked a keyboard will open with all characters enabled. Except when a blue square is clicked, in that case only five characters are enabled. A keyboard is made of buttons with every button representing one String of the symbols variable. An ActionListener is also added to each button. When a button on the keyboard is clicked, the String of that button will be retrieved and transformed into a character. The square that was clicked on the crossword will get this information and the character variable will be set to the chosen character. The String will also be shown in the interface of the crossword with the setText() method. If a blue square is clicked, the blueValue of the square will be retrieved. The blueValue will be put into an ArrayList together with 4 random characters. The random characters are determined by the method getBlueKeys(String[][] symbols). The method also makes sure a random character can’t be present in the ArrayList more than once. 

The Crossword class contains a constructor, a ComputeActionListener, the main method and SwingUtilities. The Crossword class will get all the information from the input file in the main method, and build the crossword GUI in the constructor. In the main method the information from the config.properties file is first retrieved. This file contains the filename and the solution. Two puzzles are made: crosswordPuzzle and sol. sol is a puzzle with known width and height. The width is equal to the length of the solution and the height is 1. The solutionPuzzle solPuzzle is made by putting sol as an parameter to the constructor. 

The file is read with BufferedReader. The first line contains the width and height of the crosswordPuzzle. With the method setWidthHeight(width, height) the width and height of crosswordPuzzle is set. The next lines until height + 1 is reached are put into one String called grid. Every time a String is added, a space is also added. The added space makes it so that all Strings will have the same format. This helps us avoid bugs later down the line. The rest of the lines contain the questions of the text panel. They will be added to the crosswordPuzzle with the method addPanel(line). The grid String will be split determined by the spaces and put into an array called sqCharacters. The for loop will go over every String in the array. Depending on the String, “O”, “X”, “H” or “S”, different squares will be made and added to the crosswordPuzzle with the addSquares method. The width and height of every square will also be determined and for the BlueSquares also the blueValue will be determined. In a separate for loop CheckSquares are added to the solPuzzle, together with the character of the solution. 

The GUI consists out of three panels. The first panel shows the questions of the puzzle, the second panel shows the crossword and the third panel shows the solutionPuzzle. The panel with the questions is made by getting the information out of crosswordPuzzle with the getPanel() method. The second panel consist of CrosswordButtons. Only if the color of the square is white, gray or blue, the CrosswordButton will also implement an ActionListener. The ActionListener is used to show a keyboard when these squares/CrosswordButtons are clicked.  The third panel consists of the solPuzzle and a Jbutton called check. The information of the solPuzzle Is retrieved by using the getCheck() method. Then CrosswordButtons are made for every CheckSquare. The button check also adds an ActionListener, which will check if the answer is equal to the solution. 

This project can use different puzzles granted that they use the same format. One would only have to change the names in the config.properties file to run a new puzzle. Another strength is that it would be rather easy to add a new square with a different color and different rules.
